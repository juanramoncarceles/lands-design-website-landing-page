            <p>Turn your 2D sketch into a 3D project ready for visualization. Generate 2D technical plans from the 3D model and add dimensions, labels, tags, plant photos and other annotations to get the project ready for documentation. Produce different layouts such as setting out plan, irrigation, and dimension plan by using the layer manager to organize your project. Use the listing tools to generate quantity take-offs for plants, urban furniture elements, zones or volume of cuts and fills from terrain operations.</p>

            <p>The multiple file formats supported by Lands Design let you import and export files with other platforms. Many block libraries from the web are compatible and can be easily integrated into your project. In this way, you can bring your project into a virtual reality environment, send it to a 3D printer or export it to web browsers, so you can share your project with others to visualize it by their own device.</p>
